# Introduction
My goal for this project was to support Los Angeles Apparel manage there fabric inventory audit data in order to support the administrative staff in their daily operations.
# Tools
- **Excel:** Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- **Power BI:** Dashboard
# Data Cleaning and Validation
### Cleaning Process:
1. Correcting Data Types:
- Converted 'System Entry Date' and 'Received Date' to proper date formats. Encountered and corrected a date format error where the year '2020' was incorrectly entered as '0202'.
- Changed 'Received Pcs', 'Initial Stock Pcs', 'Adjusted #Pcs', and 'Final Count Pcs' to decimal numbers to reflect precise inventory counts.
2. Handling Conversion Errors:
- Addressed an error in 'Received Date' due to an incorrect entry that prevented conversion to a date type. Replaced the entry with the correct date.
- Removed non-numeric characters (e.g., "|") in 'Adjusted #Pcs' that prevented conversion to a numeric type.
3. Removing Duplicates:
- Identified and removed duplicate records based on 'Lot #' to ensure each lot is uniquely represented in the dataset.
### Discrepancies Identified:
1. Negative or Zero 'Received Pcs':
- Found instances where 'Received Pcs' were less than or equal to zero. A value less than or equal to zero doesn't make sense because it suggests that no pieces were received.
2. Negative or Zero 'Initial Stock Pcs':
- Similar to 'Received Pcs,' the 'Initial Stock Pcs' should logically be a positive number because it reflects the count of fabric pieces when initially recorded in the inventory system.
3. Negative 'Final Count Pcs':
- Observed negative values in 'Final Count Pcs.' A negative final count would suggest that more pieces were removed from the inventory than were available, which under normal circumstances, should be impossible unless there is an error.
### Data Validation Rules Implemented:
To prevent these errors from occuring in the future, I implemented these data validation rules:
1. Non-negative Inventory Counts:
- Ensured that 'Received Pcs', 'Initial Stock Pcs', and 'Final Count Pcs' cannot accept negative numbers or zero through conditional formatting rules and data validation in the spreadsheet.
2. Date Format:
- Applied data validation to ensure all date fields are entered in a consistent and correct format.
3. Duplicate Entry Prevention:
- Set up a validation rule that checks for and alerts the user to potential duplicate entries based on 'Lot #' when new data is entered into the system.
# What are your observations about this dataset?
- **Total # Unique Lots:** There are 2563 unique lots in total.
- **Unique Lots Audited:** 2462 lots have been audited, which is 96.1% of the total lots.
- **Unique Lots Remaining to be Audited:** There are 101 unique lots yet to be audited, making up 3.9% of the total lots.
- **Total Adjustments (Pcs):** The total adjustments made are -236.3 pieces, indicating a decrease and accounting for -4.3% of the total pieces when compared to the initial records.
  
The formulas can be found in the excel file 'Analysis' tab.
# Dashboard
![Dashboard](los_angeles_apparel_dashboard_image.png)
I am sharing the dashboard as a image because I was unable to publish the dashboard to Power BI service since it requires a pro subscription or work account which I do not have.
- **Power BI Desktop File:** I will share the .pbix file, which can be downloaded and viewed using **Power BI Desktop**. Here is the file: ![dashboard download](los_angeles_apparel_dashboard.pbix) click on 'View Raw'

This dashboard provides a real-time overview for the inventory lot audit process. Itâ€™s designed to help the admin staff to track the current project status, identify any lots that remain to be audited, and shows the estimated remaining time to completion **(days)**.
